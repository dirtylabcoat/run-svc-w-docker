# Run various services with Docker
I run a lot of things in Docker-containers, both for work and for my personal experiments, and this is a repo to collect those things in. Some of it has been collected from various tutorials that I've found online and since forgotten about, some I've written from scratch. If you see any of your own code in this repo, let me know so I can give proper credit.
